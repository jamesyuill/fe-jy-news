**JY News - A Northcoders Application Project**

During my time enrolled in the Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp, we spent two weeks creating a news application.

[==check out hosted app here==](http://www.)

The first week was spent developing the backend, using Node.js, Postgresql, Express and all developed with TDD.

  

During the second week, we built the frontend, using React and React-Router-Dom, alongside Axios for the api calls to the server.

  

Although our main emphasis was on functionality, we were also required to give the application a small amount of styling. I was also keen for it to be responsive from the start.
